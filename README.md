# RAP-peer-review

Task &amp; Finish group looking at demand and options for a peer-review scheme in UK-gov RAP

The aim of this group is to:
1.	Estimate the demand for a peer review scheme for RAP,
2.	to find out or estimate how many people are willing to participate in such a scheme and how much time they would be able to commit,
3.	and to run and evaluate a demonstration peer review using an established process such as [ROpenSci's process](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html);
   a.	if you find the demonstration peer review to be successful then to make recommendations for how the overall scheme might operate.
   b.	If it is not successful then it might be useful to make recommendations on why this was.
