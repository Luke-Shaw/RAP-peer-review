# Meeting 4

## Actions

Decided at the end of the meeting.

* Alex - set up GitHub repo for final report (probably an .Rmd file)
* Alex - schedule meeting for ~ 2 weeks time to discuss final report
* Luke - meeting notes
* Paul - add survey results section to final report once exists
* Luke - add trial feedback section to final report once exists
* all - think about what our recommendations should be as a result of the task-and-finish group

## Attendees

* Alex (meeting chair)
* Luke
* David
* Paul

## Survey Feedback

Paul went through the [survey results](../survey/survey_results.docx). 

## What next

Obviously RAP meeting on April 15th has been cancelled due to Covid-19, so we won't present there.

Alex is planning on organising virtual RAP meet-ups, probably one in June and one in July. We could present at that.

Good to have one final report. That should be our next focus.

## Final report

Split into 3 sections

a) Survey results
b) Trial feedback 
c) Recommendations

First 2 should be quick, third is what we need to agree on.
