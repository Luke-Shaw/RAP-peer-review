# Review of CQC R Package

Package Author: Warwick, CQC

Package Reviewer: Luke, DfE

Review date: 2020-03-06

# Overview

This peer-review was a success, despite cross-gov departmental IT issues. Both reviewer and author found it useful, and in total the reviewer spent about one working day on it (including meetings, reviewing, and write-up). NB details of the package excluded as it is not in the public domain.

# Recommendations for Cross-Gov Peer Review

* use ROpenSci system.

* A peer review should have the following stages:

1. author details package, via README.md document, including the techniques used in the package
2. reviewer offers to review package, including a time-frame for when the final review document will be submitted. The review document uses [the pkgreviewr example template](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkgreviewr/blob/master/inst/examples/example-pkgreview.md)
3. author and reviewer agree review to take place, including time-frame and how the package will be shared. This includes security details and how the information will be stored, and if it is to be removed once the review is finished.
4. 20% of the way into the time-frame, have a scheduled *check-in* meeting, where the package author and reviewer meet to discuss whether the reviewer can run the package on their machine. This allows time for resolving issues that may be to do with different IT systems. Others may be brought in to assist, for example via the [gov data science slack](govdatascience.slack.com). At this point, the review can be cancelled if the problems seem insurmountable. 
5. Wrap-up meeting at end where feedback (sent by reviewer in advance) is discussed.
