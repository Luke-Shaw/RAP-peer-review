## Survey to assess the demand for RAP peer review across the RAP Champions Network

### Introduction

One of the terms of reference that Reproducible Analtical Pipeline (RAP)
champions sign up to is to take part in the RAP Peer Review scheme.
Until this point we haven’t developed this scheme across government.

The aims of a RAP peer review scheme include:

  - Improve the quality of coding and in particular promoting the use of
    RAPs

  - Provide feedback on code to support development of use and quality
    of RAP

  - Improve cross department development by reviewing each others code

  - Helping people develop the ability to see how other organisations
    apply RAP

  - Develop good practises from other authors and reviewers

  - `Distinguish from QA - how it's been written, have they done what
    they've said they've done.`

This survey is to help us assess the demand for a RAP peer review
scheme, how many people are willing to participate in such a scheme and
how much time they can commit. Once we understand the commitment and
desire, and what a case study looks like, we will present the results to
the RAP Champions network.

1.  Please select which Civil Service department you are in: <br> `drop
    down menu with options`

2.  If other department, please state which divison and function: <br>

RAPs can be defined as a process that carries out all analtical steps,
from extracting, manipulation and presentation of data and quality
assurance of output, in one open source software programme. RAPs can be
broken down into differents “levels”, depending on the complexity and
layout of the code used. For example, the below table briefly summaries
different levels of RAPs:

| Level                                               | Description                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ad hoc code                                         | Separate scripts for extracting, manipulating and creating output                              |
| Code in project                                     | Scripts that go from extracting data to output all in one project together                     |
| Code in project with version control (VC)           | As above, but using VC (such as git) to collaborate, share and record changes to code          |
| Functional code in project with VC and unit testing | As above, but with defined functions in scripts (which are unit tested) to carry our processes |
| Functions in package with VC and unit testing       | Functions used by scripts added to a package that is tested and shareable                      |

4.  Using the above table, how would you best describe your experience
    of coding and using RAPs?

<!-- end list -->

  - Code in project
  - Code in project with version control (VC)
  - Functional code in project with VC and unit testing

6.  If yes, please provide your email address: <br> `free text`

Coding reviews support quality of code and provide opportunities for
learning and development both through having your code reviewed and by
reviewing others code.

7.  Are you part of a peer review scheme, either within your department,
    with other departments or outside the Civil Service, such as
    rOpenSci?

<!-- end list -->

  - yes
  - no

If no, please go to question 10, otherwise:

8.  Have you had code reviewed as part of this scheme?

<!-- end list -->

  - yes
  - no

<!-- end list -->
